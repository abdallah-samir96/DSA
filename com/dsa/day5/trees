- Recursion performance is not efficient
- Size of Tree is the number of Nodes in the tree.
- In Binary tree, we ca add the element to any position in the tree, but in binary search tree we should add it to specific position
- Binary search tree, should include only unique values
- Binary Search Tree
    - Is binary tree (2 nodes in each node at maximum)
    - left is less than the node, right is > the node
    - to get the smallest element in binary search tree it will be the most left node
                   4
                 /   \

               / \   / \
              1   3 5   7


- Worst case in binary search tree is O(n).
