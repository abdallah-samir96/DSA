- trees are used in compiler expressions.
- Tree Components
    - Root
    - Nodes
    - Edge
    - Leaf
    - Subtrees
    - Sibling 2 nodes on the same level and have the same parent
    - Path a sequence of edges.
    - Size number of nodes in the tree
    - Depth is the number of edges from the node to the root.

- Binary tree is a tree wih 2 nodes only in each branch.
- No more than 2 Nodes in each Node

- How to Traverse Tree
    - pre-order  -> Root then Left, Right
    - in-order   -> Left subtree, then root node, then  right sub-tree
    - post-order -> Left subtree, Right sub-tree, Root Node.

- All arithmetic operations are evaluated in-order.
