***********************************************
- Lifecycle contains a group of phases.
- Plugin is a group of Goals
- Maven not execute the phases, only execute the Goals associated to the phases.
- mvn phase-one here maven will execute all goals associated to this phase.
- phases are ordered so if you run phase5, here all phases before phase 5 will be run first.
- Maven only run the goals inside the plugins.
- Goals is the Task.

- Clean, Default, Site are a lifecycle.

****************************************************************
- Maven contains 3 main lifecycles
    - clean    -> for deleting the target file from the working directory
    - default  -> for compiling, packaging, deploying
    - site     -> generate documentation and its site generation(such as maven site)


- we have only 3 lifecycle in Maven
** Clean lifecycle
    - pre-clean        mvn pre-clean
    - clean            mvn clean(this is phase) or mvn clean:clean(this is the goal on clean plugin)
    - post-clean       mvn post-clean
** most of maven plugins has help goal     mvn clean:help

** Site lifecycle
    - pre-site
    - site          mvn site = mvn site:site   the site phase is associated to the site goal in the site plugin
    - post-site
    - site-deploy   mvn site-deploy = mvn site:deploy

- we have 23 phase in the default lifecycle, but only we used the most common used which are 6 phases.
** Default lifecycle
    - validate      -> dependencies are downloaded correctly, available
    - compile       -> compile the java code
    - test          -> run the unit testing (we can test the project before packaging)
    - package       -> package file
    - install       -> install the jar file into the local repository
    - deploy        -> deploy the jar, war, ear, rar, ejb into the web server, or to remote repository


** mvn compiler:help to display the help of this plugin
** we only run goals or phases
** mvn help:describe -Dcmd=compile here will display the lifecycle and associated goals.

Maven Archetypes
- we have a lot of ready archetypes we can generate using the command line.
