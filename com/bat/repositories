- Maven will download dependencies from remote Repository to /users/user/.m2 directory
- After then will read the dependency from local Repository
- The dependencies will include (jar file(classes), sources, documentations, checksum files)
- mvn dependency:tree to get all dependency our project depends on.
- if there is more than one dependency with the same name, maven will use maven mediation to get only one.
- The maven mediation may cause errors in case of different versions in dependencies it depend on.
- scopes in dependencies are (compile, runtime, test, system, import, provided)
- <optional>true<optional> if i need to use dependency and the project depend on me must write it if he need it.
- Example if i made a hibernates library here i will depend on all database drivers, so i will make all of them
  optional, so the project depend on me should only determine the needed driver not include all drivers.
*****************************************
- Repository Manager acts as a proxy to remote repositories
- We can push our own artifacts into remote repositories such as
    - Nexus
    - Apache Archive
- We can define specific repository for maven to search the artifacts on it.

mvn help:effective-pom

Plugins
- All work by maven is based on plugins
- There is 2 types of plugins
    - build plugins which used in build and includes in <build> element
    - reporting plugins which used in reporting ans site generation and includes in <reporting> element

- Most of time we use the build plugins.
<build>
<finalName>jarFile</finalName>   => this is the jar file name instead of used from artifact-version.jar
<plugins>
    - here we add the plugin
</plugins>
</build>
- To display more info about specific goal inside plugin
- mvn clean:help -Dgoal=clean -Ddetail=true
- Some of plugins needed dependencies, so there is element <dependencies> inside the plugins to add dependency that the plugin depends on.

- mvn help:describe -Dcmd=compile
- mvn help:describe -Dcmd=compiler:compile
- mvn dependency:analyze -> this goal will show all unused dependencies.
- mvn dependency:tree    ->
- Fat jar is a jar that contains all jars that depend on.
- thin jar is only jar contains .class files of its own.
- jar file created by maven is not executable Jar.
- mvn dependency:copy-dependencies will extract all dependencies into the target directory as jar files.
*********************************************************************************************************************
- Effective POM is merge POM + super POM.
- Shade Plugin is used to make executable fat jar.
- Properties In Maven
- Built-in properties
- ${project.artifactId} -> will resolve it.
- ${settings.ayThing} ->  to get from settings.xml
- ${env.PATH} -> will resolve it.
- ${env.JAVA_HOME}
- User Defined
<properties>
    <junit.version>15</junit.version>
</properties>

- interpolation -> evaluate the expression for example ${example.version}

- Bandwidth refers to the maximum amount of data that can be transmitted over a network connection within a given period of time.
  It is commonly expressed in bits per second (bps) or a
  higher unit such as kilobits per second (Kbps), megabits per second (Mbps), or gigabits per second (Gbps).
- Plugins are used by Maven.
- Maven use the effective-pom not our pom.
