- Maven will download dependencies from remote Repository to /users/user/.m2 directory
- After then will read the dependency from local Repository
- The dependencies will include (jar file(classes), sources, documentations, checksum files)
- mvn dependency:tree to get all dependency our project depends on.
- if there is more than one dependency with the same name, maven will use maven mediation to get only one.
- The maven mediation may cause errors in case of different versions in dependencies it depend on.
- scopes in dependencies are (compile, runtime, test, system, import, provided)
- <optional>true<optional> if i need to use dependency and the project depend on me must write it if he need it.
- Example if i made a hibernates library here i will depend on all database drivers, so i will make all of them
  optional, so the project depend on me should only determine the needed driver not include all drivers.

*****************************************
- Repository Manager acts as a proxy to remote repositories
- We can push our own artifacts into remote repositories such as
    - Nexus
    - Apache Archive

- We can define specific repository for maven to search the artifacts on it.
